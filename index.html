        <h1>Learning About GitHub and Unix Shell</h1>
        <p>This is going to a <b>short and simple</b> webpage for coding beginers</p>

        <h2><u>What is GitHub?</u></h2>
        <p>GitHub is a <b>free</b> online service that allows people to use git to create code repositories, which are
            containers for code. <a href="https://github.com">A link to GitHub.</a></p>
        <p>Things covered in the next section:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What is a branch?</li>
            <li>What is a commit?</li>
            <li>What is a pull request?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A branch is a section of code that has been seperated from the main branch of code, so that you can can work
            making changes without distrubing the main or master code. A branch should have a new and different name to
            the main code, every repository can one or more branches. <br></vr><b><u>DO NOT MESS WITH THE MAIN
                    BRANCH!</u></b></p>
        <P>A commit is a save point for your code, while writing your code you can commit it to GitHub. The only helpful
            thing that happens once you commit multiple sections of code you make a breadcrumb trail or history of the
            previous code you've written, which is helpful for you and anyone else working on the project.</P>
        <p>A pull request is a request made for the new section of code that you or someone in your group has written
            and would that code to be merged into the main or master code. A pull request will show up as a notification
            to others in the group, and then the changes proposed will be discussed, from here other people in the group
            can post feedback on the pull request and even add their own tweak with thier own commits.</p>
        <p>There is a GitHub desktop app, that in my short personal experience I have found it to be very help, showing
            things that are gonig to added and thing you have removed. You can easily use this a starting point for you
            offline code and then commit and branches you have made. I highly reccommend</p>

        <h2><u>What is Unix Shell</u></h2>
        <p>Unix shell is a great way to manipluate folder and files, wether that me making new ones or move already
            excisting one around. On windows it simple be accessed by opening a commmand window (windows key + cmd),
            then typing powershell. For Mac you can use a Bash is a good option. </p>
