        <p>Things covered in the next section:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is a branch?</li>
            <li>What is a commit?</li>
            <li>What is a pull request?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A branch is a section of code that has been seperated from the main branch of code, so that you can can work making changes without distrubing the main or master code. A branch should have a new and different name to the main code, every repository can one or more branches. <br></vr><b><u>DO NOT MESS WITH THE MAIN BRANCH!</u></b> </p>
