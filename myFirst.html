        <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
        <p><u>GitHub is a <b>free</b> online service that allows people to use git to create code repositories, which are containers for code. <a href="https://github.com">A link to GitHub.</a></u></p><br>
        <p>Things covered in the next section:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is a branch?</li>
            <li>What is a commit?</li>
            <li>What is a pull request?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A branch is a section of code that has been seperated from the main branch of code, so that you can can work making changes without distrubing the main or master code. A branch should have a new and different name to the main code, every repository can one or more branches. <br></vr><b><u>DO NOT MESS WITH THE MAIN BRANCH!</u></b></p>
        <P>A commit is a save point for your code, while writing your code you can commit it to GitHub. The only helpful thing that happens once you commit multiple sections of code you make a breadcrumb trail or history of the previous code you've written, which is helpful for you and anyone else working on the project.</P>
        <p>A pull request is a request made for the new section of code that you or someone in your group has written and would that code to be merged into the main or master code. A pull request will show up as a notification to others in the group, and then the changes proposed will be discussed, from here other people in the group can post feedback on the pull request and even add their own tweak with thier own commits.</p><br><br>
